## üß† Problem File (``Op_problems/<your-problem>/problem.json``)

Each problem is defined via a JSON file with the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `parameters` | List of problem parameters `x{i}` |
| `variables` | List of model variables `y{i}` |
| `objective` | Objective function (use empty string to use the default quadratic objective) |
| `constraints` | List of equality and inequality constraints |
| `file_name` | Name of the dataset file (CSV with columns for both parameters and variables) |

> **Note:**  
> We use the notation `x{index}` for parameters and `y{index}` for variables across all problems.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File (``Op_problems/<your-problem>/model_config.json``)

This file controls the training and solver configuration. The following keys are available:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `num_epochs` | Number of training epochs |
| `lr` | Optimizer learning rate |
| `eta` | Threshold for activating Newton layer |
| `hidden_dim` | MLP hidden dimension |
| `pinn_reg_factor` | Regularization coefficient for PINN terms |
| `model_loss_tolerance` | Loss threshold for stopping training |
| `newton_step_length` | Step size used in Newton update |
| `newton_tol` | Tolerance for Newton convergence |
| `newton_reg_factor` | Regularization used in Newton step (for ill-conditioned systems) |
| `max_newton_iter` | Maximum number of Newton iterations per epoch |
| `batch_size` | Training batch size |
| `train_split_size` | Dataset training split ratio |
| `val_split_size` | Dataset validation split ratio |
| `test_split_size` | Dataset test split ratio |
| `save_checkpoint_iter` | Checkpoint save frequency (in epochs) |
| `mlp_checkpoint_path` | Path to a pretrained MLP model (optional) |
| `pinn_checkpoint_path` | Path to a pretrained PINN model (optional) |
| `kkt_hardnet_checkpoint_path` | Path to a pretrained KKT-HardNet model (optional) |

## üíæ Checkpoint Strategy

- Training resumes from checkpoint if provided; otherwise, it starts from scratch.
- For KKT-HardNet, if the checkpoint loss is already below `eta`, the Newton layer will be activated from the first epoch.
- A new checkpoint is only saved if the current epoch has a lower loss than the previous checkpoint.
- Three types of checkpoints are created: **MLP**, **PINN**, and **KKT-HardNet** (useful for transfer learning).

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è How to Create Your Own Dataset
- Define the problem (`problem.json`). This file specifies the problem as a dictionary.
  - Input variables (features/parameters): name them sequentially as `x1, x2, x3, ‚Ä¶`  
  - Output variables (decision variables): name them sequentially as `y1, y2, y3, ‚Ä¶`
  - Inputs go under `"parameters"`. Outputs go under `"variables"`.
  - Constraints should be given as a list of strings. Use "==" for equality and ">="/"<=" for inequality inside the strings.
  - Specify the data file in `"file_name"`.
 
- Prepare the dataset (`.csv`)
  - The header row must contain the parameters and variables as defined in the problem file.
  - Ensure column names in the CSV match the names listed in "parameters" and "variables" of problem.json.

- Configure the `model_config.json` file
  - Training: `num_epochs`, `lr`, `batch_size`
  - Splits: `train_split_size`, `val_split_size`, `test_split_size`
  - Newton/KKT settings: `newton_tol`, `max_newton_iter`, `newton_step_length`, etc.
  - Checkpoints: configure how often to save models (`save_checkpoint_iter`) and paths for reloading.

Keep all the files in one folder inside the `OP_problems` folder. For any confusion please check the given example problems inside the `Op_problems` folder.

## ‚úÖ Checking the Results

After a successful run, the following files are saved in `./Op_problems/<your-problem>`:
